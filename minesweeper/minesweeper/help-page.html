	<p>Although its first appearance on a Windows machine was in 1980, MineSweeper, continues to confuse and intrigue players around the world.</p>
	<p> The rules can certainly come off as daunting, but once you see how it all comes together, you'll wonder how you went so long without knowing it.
	<br>
	In brief, this tutorial will walk you through how to play MineSweeper and provide a couple tricks to get you defusing on the right foot.</p>
		
		<p>MineSweeper consists of a sea of tiles. Each tile hides a space containing one of 3 things: a number, a blank space, or a mine. <br>
		If you click on a mine, the game is over!</p>

			<p><b>Number Spaces</b><br>
			A number spaces denotes how many spaces adjacent to that one contain a mine. For the example below, the "1" means that one and only one of the 8 surrounding tiles is concealing a mine.</p>

			<p><b>Blank Spaces</b><br>
			A blank space indicates that there are <i>no</i> mines adjacent to the given space. <br>Clicking a tile over a blank space not only reveals every adjacent blank space to that tile, but also every number space adjacent to the new blank spaces! (bear with me, you'll see what I mean!)<br>
			This makes finding blank spaces invaluable!</p>

			<p><b>Mine Spaces</b><br>
			Mine spaces are scattered all over the playfield. The number in the top right indicates how many undiscovered mines are left in the field.<br> Flagging tiles you are convinced are mines decreases the counter.<br> To flag/unflag a mine simply <i>left-click</i> on a tile. Flagging a mine prevents the tile from being selected. <br>Try not to flag tiles that you can't be certain are mines! <br>
			Try it out:
			</p>
			<button class="test" style='height: 26.5px; width:26.5px; pointer-events: auto; border: 3.5px outset darkgrey'></button>
		
		<p>
		Now that you've mastered the basics, let's take a peak at a couple basic strategies.</p>
		<p> Often you will see areas similar to the one pictured below. In other words, a space with a "1" that only has one covered tile adjacent to it. These spaces are definitely mines.</p>
			<img src="Images/Help/minetut4.png" width="100" height="100"></li>
			<p> Likewise if you have a space with a "2" in an arranged such as below. You can flag the tile right below it (marked with a superscript 2) aswell, as it is definitely a mine. </p><br> 
			<i>Can you guess what the blank tile is?</i><br>
			It is <b><i>not</i></b> a mine! </p>
			<img src="Images\Help\minetut5.png" >
			<p>The above rule can be applied to any number of cascading sequential mine blocks as seen below.</p>

			<p>Now that you have the gist of MineSweeper, go ahead and close the help window and start sweeping!</p>
